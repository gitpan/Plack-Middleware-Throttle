NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Throttle - A Plack Middleware for rate-limiting
    incoming HTTP requests.

SYNOPSIS
      my $handler = builder {
        enable "Throttle::Hourly",
            max     => 2,
            backend => Plack::Middleware::Throttle::Backend::Hash->new(),
            path    => qr{^/api};
        sub { [ '200', [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/html' ], ['hello world'] ] };
      };

DESCRIPTION
    This is a "Plack" middleware that provides logic for rate-limiting
    incoming HTTP requests to Rack applications.

    This middleware provides three ways to handle throttling on incoming
    requests :

    Hourly
        How many requests an host can do in one hour. The counter is reseted
        each hour.

    Daily
        How many requets an host can do in one hour. The counter is reseted
        each day.

    Interval
        Which interval of time an host must respect between two request.

OPTIONS
    code
        HTTP code returned in the response when the limit have been
        exceeded. By default 503.

    message
        HTTP message returned in the response when the limit have been
        exceeded. By defaylt "Over rate limit".

    backend
        A cache object to store sessions informations.

          backend => Redis->new(server => '127.0.0.1:6379');

        or

          backend => Cache::Memcached->new(servers => ["10.0.0.15:11211", "10.0.0.15:11212"]);

        The cache object must implement get, set and incr methods. By
        default, you can use "Plack::Middleware::Throttle::Backend::Hash".

        By default, if no backend is specified,
        Plack::Middleware::Throttle::Backend::Hash is used.

    key_prefix
        Key to prefix sessions entry in the cache.

    path
        URL pattern or a callback to match request to throttle. If no path
        is specified, the whole application will be throttled.

    white_list
        An arrayref of hosts to put in a white list.

    black_list
        An arrayref of hosts to put in a black list.
